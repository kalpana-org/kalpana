Zen of Kalpana
==============

If you don't know how to use it<br />
It's not for you<br />
(Or you can learn it)

Helpfullness is nice<br />
But shouldn't be neccessary

~
###Remove, refactor, don't add###

~

More than one way<br />
To do something<br />
Is far too many<br />
_And should be removed_

Remotely similar<br />
Is too similar<br />
_And should be removed_


If your code looks like crap<br />
It probably is<br />
_And should be removed_

~

When in doubt<br />
Remove it<br />
You probably don't need it anyway
