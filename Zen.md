Zen of Kalpana
==============

If you don't know how to use it
It's not for you
(Or you can learn it)

Helpfullness is nice
But shouldn't be neccessary

~
###Remove, refactor, don't add###

~

More than one way
To do something
Is far too many
_And should be removed_

Remotely similar
Is too similar
_And should be removed_


If your code looks like crap
It probably is
_And should be removed_

~

When in doubt
Remove it
You probably don't need it anyway
